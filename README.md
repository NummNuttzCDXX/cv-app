## Learned
Coming into this project, I wasn't quite sure the benefits of using React, because I already know how to do everything that React can do (that I know of) and I've been fine without it so far. Now, as I'm finishing up this project, I can definitely see the benefits. Not only does working with React make things a little easier and cleaner, I also found it was kind of fun.

At first, I found it strange to be writing almost all of my HTML inside of my Javascript files. It felt unnatural and just plain weird, I did not like it. I still feel that way, somewhat, but overall I enjoy working with React.
